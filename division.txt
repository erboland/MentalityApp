Lesson 1
1) How to divide on abacus?
#######
Performing division on the Abacus is more difÔ¨Åcult, however it is really just multiplication in 
reverse. We will use a multiplication or times table to look up results on the right and get the 
result on the left instead. 
The right rods start with dividend and will be used to keep track of the remainders. The left 
rods are for quotient (the result of the division). 
#######
When we have a 3 digit dividend and a 1 digit divisor, we will need to use 5 rods as shown in 
the picture above. When we have a 4 digit dividend and a 2 digit divisor, we will need to use 
6 rods as shown in the last example below.  Different numbers of rods are needed for 
different sizes of dividends and divisors.  Note that there are many methods of doing division 
on the Abacus. The method shown here is just one of them.
