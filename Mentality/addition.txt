Hello! Now, you’re starting the greatest adventure to the world of arithmetic. You will learn a lot of interesting stuff!
What are we going to ask?
1) What is mental math?
2) On which technic is based mental math?
3) What is abacus?
#######
What is mental math?
Mental math is unique method aimed to develop mental abilities of people based on verbal counting. Learning this techniques person will achieve unbelievable level of solving math operations such as summarizing, subtraction, multiplication and dividing.
#######
On which technic is based mental math?
Innovate I is the most progressive program of Mental arithmetic. It was developed in Malaysia and children of Malaysian Royal Family is studying with it. More than 5 million people from 56 countries learned it.
#######
What is abacus? The abacus is an ancient calculator still used in China and other Asian countries. In Chinese it is called a “Suanpan”. It is a frame divided into an upper and lower section by a bar called the “beam.” The abacus can be used for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
#######
Lesson1
What are we going to ask?
1) How to sum directly on abacus?
#######
When the lower beads or the upper beads are moved toward the beams (move up lower beads or move down upper beads), it means addition.
#######
Lesson 2
What are we going to ask?
1) What is Little friend?
2)  How can we divide 5
#######
1) When performing addition, always ﬁnish moving beads on the current rod before dealing with any carry to the tens rod or rod to the left. When there are not enough lower beads to add or move up, we need to use one of the formulas to help. In this tutorial, we introduce little friend.
#######
2) 5 with 2 and 3 . The little friend of 2 is 3. To move up 2, we move up 5 and down little friend, 3. To move up 3, we move up 5 and down little friend 2.5 with 1 and 4.The little friend of 1 is 4 and of 4 is 1. To move up 1, we move up 5 and down little friend 4. To move up 4,we move up 5 and down little friend 1.
#######
Lesson 3
How to add 1, 2, 3, 4?
#######
Lesson 4 
What are we going to ask?
1) What is big friend?
2) What pairs of 10 do we have?
#######
When performing addition, always ﬁnish moving beads on the current rod before dealing with any carry to the tens rod or rod to the left. When there are not enough beads to add or move up, we need to use one of the formulas to help. In this tutorial, we introduce big friend.
#######
For example, the big friend of 1 is 9 and of 9 is 1. To move up 1, we move down big friend 9 and move up 10. To move up 9, we move down big friend 1 and move up 10 (or 1 on the next rod).
#######
Lesson 5
What are we going to ask?
1) How to add with big friends?
#######
Lesson 6
In progress….
