Hello! Now, you’re starting the greatest adventure to the world of arithmetic. You will learn a 
lot of interesting stuff!
What are we going to ask?
1) What is mental math?
2) On which technic is based mental math?
3) What is abacus?
#######
What is mental math?
Mental math is unique method aimed to develop mental abilities of people based on verbal 
counting. Learning this techniques person will achieve unbelievable level of solving math 
operations such as summarizing, subtraction, multiplication and dividing.
#######
On which technic is based mental math?
Innovate I is the most progressive program of Mental arithmetic. It was developed in 
Malaysia and children of Malaysian Royal Family is studying with it. More than 5 million 
people from 56 countries learned it. 
#######
What is abacus?
The abacus is an ancient calculator still used in China and other Asian countries. In Chinese it 
is called a “Suanpan”. It is a frame divided into an upper and lower section by a bar called the 
“beam.” The abacus can be used for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
#######
Lesson1
What are we going to ask
1) How to subtract directly on abacus? 
#######
When the lower beads or the upper beads are moved away from the beams (move down 
lower beads or move up upper beads), it means subtraction. 
Lesson 2
1) What is Little Friend?
2) How can we divide 5?
#######
1) When performing subtraction, always borrow from the tens rod (or rod on the left) before 
       ﬁnishing moving beads on the current rod. When there are not enough lower beads to 
       subtract or move down, we need to use one of the formulas to help.  In this tutorial, 
       we need to move down the upper bead instead and move up the lower beads our little 
       friend.
2) 5 with 1 and 4. The little friend of 1 is 4 and of 4 is 1. To move down 1 we move up little 
friend 4 and move down 5. To move down 4 we move up little friend 1 and move down 5. 
5 with 2 and 3. The little friend of 2 is 3 and of 3 is 2. To move down 2, we move up little 
friend 3 and move down 5. To move down 3 we move up little friend 2 and move down 5. 
#######
Lesson 3
1) How to subtract 1, 2, 3, 4?
#######
Lesson 4
What are we going to ask?
1) What is Big Friend?
2) What pairs of 10 do we have?
#######
When performing subtraction, always borrow from the tens rod (or rod on the left) before 
ﬁnishing moving beads on the current rod. When there are not enough beads to subtract or 
move down, we need to use one of the formulas to help. In this tutorial, we use big friend.  
For example, the big friend of 2 is 8 and of 8 is 2. To move down 2, we move down 10 (or 1 
in next rod) and move up big friend 8. To move down 8, we move down 10 and move up big 
friend 2.

Lesson 5
What are we going to ask?
  •        How to subtract with big friends?
